Season the Wagyu short ribs on both sides with salt and pepper, and coat the outside with flour.
Set a large roasting pan over high heat and add vegetable oil. 
Once hot, sear the meat in the pan, about 8 minutes on each side, until a crust forms.
Remove the meat from the pan and set aside.
In the same pan, add the carrots and caramelize. 
As they begin to brown, add the onions and caramelize. 
Then add the celery. 
As the vegetables begin to brown, add the tomato paste and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. 
Add in the red wine and allow it to reduce by half. 
Add back in the meet and the herbs, and pour in beef broth to cover 3/4 up the meat. 
Wrap the pan in foil, and cook at 275 degrees fahrenheit for at least 4 hours.
Once cooked, remove the met from the liquid, and strain. 
Reduce the liquid over medium heat, skimming fat as needed. Use this as sauce for the ribs.
