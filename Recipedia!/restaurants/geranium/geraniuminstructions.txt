Mix the salt and sugar with a gallon of water and stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. 
Submerge the trout in this brine and put in the fridge, covered.
Remove the trout from the brine (discard the brine). 
Pat dry with paper towels and set on a rack over a baking sheet in the fridge. 
You can also set the fish to dry in a cool, breezy place for a few hours.
Put the fish in the smoker, hanging or on the grates, and get a nice cool smoke going. 
Slowly let the temperature rise to 200F and hold it between 175F and 200F for at least an hour.
Do not let the temperature get above 225F. If it does, set a tray of ice in the smoker. 
When your trout are smoked, you can eat them warm or chilled.
