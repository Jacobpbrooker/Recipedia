Remove 1 piece of parchment from the other puff pastry round.
Place a plate upside-down onto the pastry
Run a knife along the rim to cut a border out of the circle.
Beat egg and water together; brush over the puff pastry on the baking sheet.
Carefully remove the outer ring from the other round and line it over the edges of the brushed pastry.
Brush more egg wash over the border. Prick bottom crust with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
Immediately press the bottom of a fork onto the bottom crust to flatten it.
Combine goat cheese, salt, pepper, cayenne, dill, parsley, and lemon thyme in a bowl.
Pour in the rest of the egg wash and cream. Mix until smooth. Spoon filling onto the center of the crust and spread it out toward the border.
Continue baking until cheese filling is set and crust is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes more.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water.
